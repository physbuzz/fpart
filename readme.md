# Force-Particle Interactions
This is an educational project to experiment with calculating less-commonly
calculated observables like the free energy from a time dependent simulation
of nearly ideal and nonideal gases.

Goals:

 - Simulate simple ideal and nonideal gases
 - Use a O(N) force calculation algorithm (doesn't have to be the fastest)

Nice stretch goals:

 - Try to conduct the simulation at constant pressure 

## Code Description

- ParticleList.h does particle loading and initialization


There are three parts to this we need to:
1. Specify the simulation and set the correct parameters, then initialize it.
2. Do the time updating and time integration.
3. Collect statistics.
